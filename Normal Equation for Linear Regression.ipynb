    "1) The reason why we would use Gradient Descent in Linear Regression is because $\\textbf{it’s computationally cheaper to find optima}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The normal equations has the matrix inversion in it and inverting a matrix is an expensive operation. The design matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ has $\\textbf{k+1}$ columns where $\\textbf{k}$ is the number of predictors ($x^{1}$, $x^{2}$, $x^{3}$,…) and $\\textbf{m rows}$ of samples. If the number of samples < 100, then it is quicker to use the normal equations than Gradient Descent. But, in real life, $\\textbf{k}$ is easily greater than 1,000 and sample size will be greater than 100k. Since the matrix inversion is (O($n^{3}$)), inverting X'X (1,000 by 1,000 matrix) will take a while to calculate.\n",
